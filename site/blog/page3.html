					<p>This year at CHI we&#8217;ll be presenting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://nb.mit.edu/f/2972" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/nb.mit.edu');">paper</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://nb.mit.edu/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/nb.mit.edu');">nb</a>, a tool that lets students have forum-style threaded discussions in the margins of pdf documents.  We&#8217;ve posted it in advance at the link above in hopes of getting some comments on it that can help us prepare our presentation.  We&#8217;re also making nb available to you, if you have a paper at CHI and want some feedback on it.
<div style="position:absolute; top:-414px; left:449px"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://healthinsuranceinfo.net/newsyoucanuse/cheaper-viagra-levitra-cialis/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/healthinsuranceinfo.net');">cheaper viagra levitra cialis</a></div>
</p>
<p>We originally designed nb for class materials&#8212;lecture notes and such&#8212;under the hypothesis that attaching the forum to the content provides useful context that helps students see and participate in relevant discussions at the right moment in their reading.  Our paper shows support for this hypothesis.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ve discovered that nb is also quite useful for our research reading group.  If we post the paper in advance and everyone annotates it, we get great material for reading group discussion, nicely organized for us as we traverse the paper.   Recently, when we asked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://students.washington.edu/pchilana/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/students.washington.edu');">Parmit Chilana</a> for a pdf of their CHI <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://nb.mit.edu/f/2958" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/nb.mit.edu');">Lemonaid</a> paper so we could mark it up this way, she mentioned that she&#8217;d like to see those comments to help her prepare her CHI talk.  We thought this was a great idea, so we&#8217;re making it more generally available.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve created a CHI channel on the nb site.  You can sign on by clicking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://bit.ly/chinotes" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/bit.ly');">this link</a>.  There, you&#8217;ll be able to read and annotate/discuss any paper whose authors have provided it.   If you&#8217;re an author and want to get some reader feedback, either before or after your talk, send the paper to sacha@mit.edu and we&#8217;ll add it to the site (a bit old-fashioned, but the system isn&#8217;t currently designed to let &#8220;student readers&#8221; upload papers to their classes).</p>
<p>Of course, to get some annotations you need some readers, and our system can&#8217;t help you with that!  You&#8217;ll need to use some old fashioned techniques, like mentioning it on your blog and encouraging people to read and annotate it.  For example, consider this blog post, whose first line encourages you to read and annotate our (paper on nb) on nb.  I look forward to your comments!</p>

					<p>This is a message in a bottle.  I&#8217;ve got an idea for addressing a problem in Zimbabwe and no idea how to reach the people I&#8217;d like to share it with, so I&#8217;m going to see if perhaps it can propagate to them.</p>
<p>A couple days ago, the New York Times had an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/world/africa/using-us-dollars-zimbabwe-finds-a-problem-no-change.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.nytimes.com');">article</a> on an unusual problem in Zimbabwe: lack of coinage.  The country has adopted the US dollar to deal with hyperinflation, and dollars are in common circulation.  But coins, which are a lot heavier and harder to ship, are in short supply, which poses a problem any time people make a non-whole-dollar purchase.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://marketmonetarist.com/2012/04/26/good-e-money-can-solve-zimbabwes-coin-problem/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/marketmonetarist.com');">blog post</a> suggested a switch to electronic currency using mobile phones.  I&#8217;ve no idea how well such technology has penetrated Zimbabwe.  So I wanted to suggest a lower-tech solution.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a pretty simple trick, related to a lottery, for &#8220;rounding off&#8221; purchase prices that could eliminate the need for change.  I&#8217;ve seen it in print several times, though I can&#8217;t find a reference at the moment.  Suppose you want to make a purchase of 33 cents.  You pick a random number between 0 and 99.  If the number is less than 33, you pay a dollar; otherwise you pay nothing.  On average, you pay 33 cents.  But in fact, you pay either 0 or 1 dollars&#8212;no coins are needed.  More generally, if you owe k cents, you pay a dollar if your random number is below k; otherwise you pay nothing.</p>
<p>Of course, on a single purchase, you might be concerned about the possibility that you&#8217;ll be overpaying by a factor of 3.  Indeed, it could happen that you pay a dollar when you only owe a penny (a 1 in 100 chance).  And conversely, the store owner might worry about being paid nothing.  However, over a large number of purchases, these outcomes will average out&#8212;each customer will spend about as much as they were supposed to, and each store will receive about as much as it was supposed to.</p>
<p>To implement this, all you need is an acceptable way to generate a random number.  It needs to be low tech.  And it needs to be acceptable to both customer and merchant&#8212;each should be confident that the other cannot cheat them.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s one low-tech approach that could work.  Each participant keeps a small deck of 100 cards (or other random scraps of paper) in their pocket, numbered from 0 to 99.  To work out a payment, each participant reaches into their pocket, grabs a random card, and lays it facedown on the table.  Together, the participants then flip their cards.  Compute the sum of the two numbers shown, subtract 100 if it&#8217;s larger than 100, and use the resulting number (which will be between 0 and 99) as the random choice for the change protocol.</p>
<p>This is a good protocol because it works even if one party cheats.  To see this, suppose that the customer is playing fair, and truly choosing a random 0-99 card from their pocket.  Then it doesn&#8217;t matter what the merchant does.  For suppose the merchant chooses card k (possibly in some biased, cheating way).  Then, since the customer is choosing randomly, the resulting sum is equally likely to be any on of the numbers between k and k+99.  Once we subtract 100 from the larger outcomes, we find all numbers between 0 and 99 equally likely, as desired.</p>
<p>As a simplification, note that the customer can make their choice at home, putting just a few random cards (or, just as effective, a few scraps of paper with random numbers written on them) in their pocket in the morning and using them for the days purchases.  So long as they don&#8217;t purchase from the same merchant twice, the merchant has no information they can use to cheat the customer (conversely, if a customer returns and uses the same card, a cheating merchant can take advantage of that knowledge to ensure they get paid).   As another variant, the merchant could keep two decks, one to be used by the customer and one by the merchant.  The customer will want to inspect their deck, but this would be pretty easy if the cards were kept sorted.</p>
<p>Is this practical?  I&#8217;m not sure.  But the &#8220;only&#8221; thing it needs is some paper.  Plus some basic mathematical skill, but, importantly, the same mathematical skill needed to compute the cost of two items&#8212;a skill I think we can safely assume of anyone who is making purchases.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to float this idea past someone closer to Zimbabwe, who might be able to comment on its feasibility.  If you know someone, please pass it on!</p>

					<p>Last week I attended NICAR 2012, a conference for computer assisted investigative reporting. I was there to help David teach reporters how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://iga.edu/best-paper-writing-service-essay/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/iga.edu');" title="school writing paper">school writing paper</a> to use tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://projects.csail.mit.edu/datapress/">Datapress</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.simile-widgets.org');">Exhibit</a> and to learn about the needs and state-of-the-art of computers in reporting. It is always a privilege to get to visit and observe someone&#8217;s world as an outsider; and even more so to see how they are using tools from your world to do their work. So here are some parting thoughts I took away from the conference: NICAR from the eyes of a computer scientist.</p>
<p><strong>Visualization is just the &#8220;last mile&#8221; of data in reporting.</strong> And an optional one at that. We spend a lot of time talking about data publication and visualization tools in Haystack, but this is just one small slice of the needs of computer-assisted reporting. A story might take months of investigative work- gathering data, cleaning data, interviewing people, assembling scraps of paper &#8212; and a presentation of that data is only prepared in the final run-up to publication. That presentation isn&#8217;t always a wiz-bang interactive graphic, either. Many times a data-intensive story might be presented entirely as narrative, if the medium fits better.</p>
<p><strong>Scraping tools seriously needed</strong>. Web scraping wins the award for highest ratio of need over capability. Scraping the web is absolutely essential to do good investigative work when it comes to municipalities, many of which publish web pages with daily administrative information (such as arrests) while removing the previous days&#8217;. Without a scraper, reporters would have to spend a large portion of each day copying and pasting this information down into a spreadsheet by hand.</p>
<p><strong>Big Opportunities for Automation</strong>. Ben Welsh of the LA Times gave a great talk about how he automates his reporting through  a combination of web and email scrapers, databases, and automated copy generators. The goal being to auto-generate 100% of reactive stories (deaths, arrests, etc) and then go back and rewrite the most important ones by hand. Reminiscent of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://people.csail.mit.edu/emax/papers/atomsmasher-poster-final.pdf" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloadspeople./emax/papers/atomsmasher-poster-final.pdf');">AtomsMasher</a> for the newsroom.</p>
<p><strong>And machine learning, too</strong>. Tools that enable reporters to perform topic modeling and hierarchical clustering are making a big splash. They can go a long way toward helping a reporter understand a big data dump so they know what documents to focus on. I think the coming years are going to big for the dissemination of machine learning components into a lot of consumer software. Tools that enable reporters to say &#8220;give me more documents like these ones&#8221; will be a bit hit. </p>
<p><strong>The CMS is Broken</strong>. One refrain I heard over and over is how much the reporters have to fight with their CMS. For reasons both technical and administrative. A common solution seems to be for custom news apps to be hosted out of a subdomain on third party sites (AWS, Heroku, etc) with window dressing to provide the illusion of being a part of the main news site. However as a totally separate entity, these news apps don&#8217;t get integrated into the standard RSS feed, advertising system, top stories feature, and other critical elements of the CMS-managed web of data, casing traffic and revenue challenges for their authors.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when your paper is the business of causing protests?</strong> I went one session where the creators of <a href="curbwise.com">curbwise.com</a>, two employees from The Omaha World-Herald, discussed the hopeful (revenue-wise) but new territory of transforming the news into apps. Here&#8217;s the gist: print ad revenues are falling, but online ad revenues are a pittance in comparison. To make up for lost revenue, newspapers can exploit their intimate knowledge of a locale by creating community-specific information sites and charging for them somehow. But what happens when that site is, like Curbwise, a way to protest your home&#8217;s valuation? Now the newspaper has a financial interest in causing people to protest their home valuations. Is that territory we should be comfortable with newspapers occupying? Do they occupy it already (to the extent that extreme news is news that sells well, so there&#8217;s always an incentive to fan a fire)? Food for thought.</p>
<p><strong>Appification of news, in general</strong>. Continuing on the previous thought, there was enormous interest in the idea of transforming news into for-fee &#8220;apps&#8221; that deliver a targeted news experience. Such as paying a small fee to get your kid&#8217;s high school football scores in a format that looks like ESPN.com.</p>
<p><strong>The need for computer science as a liberal arts requirement</strong>. If ever I haveeen a good argument for computer science as a liberal arts requirement, going to NICAR was it. It was amazing and energizing to see the extent to which computers are enabling better reporting and storytelling. In some cases, surprising to see how programming has become an essential tool for some areas of reporting. In today&#8217;s world, knowing how to program better equips you to make sense of the information around you and communicate your findings to others.</p>
<p><strong>The need for computer scientists to grok liberal arts</strong>. On the other hand, we as computer scientists need to be delivering tools &#8212; serious data crunching tools, visualization tools, curation tools, scraping tools &#8212; that are built for use by people who spend their days thinking about things <em>other</em> than computers. Because I want my local reporters to spend their days fact checking the good stories, not brushing up on Python.</p>

					<p>I spent last weekend at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://pimworkshop.org/2012/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/pimworkshop.org');">2012 PIM workshop</a>, located at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://cscw2012.org/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/cscw2012.org');">CSCW 2012</a>.  This was the 5th such workshop.  Appropriately for its setting, this one focused on &#8220;PIM in a socially networked world&#8221;&#8212;i.e., the aspects of PIM emerging in the interactions between multiple individuals.  The focus clearly highlighted the distance between two different notions of PIM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information About Me</h2>
<p>Historically, PIM has studied the tools and techniques people use to work with their own personal information.  But with the emergence of social networks, many people discover that their personal information is being managed by other people.  Our tweets and Facebook status updates are clearly personal information, but we are publishing them for general consumption.  More thought provoking, one PIM attendee described her grandmother&#8217;s surprise and displeasure on discovering that she (the grandmother) had been tagged in several Facebook photos.  She wasn&#8217;t even on Facebook, yet this quite personal information was uploaded and being seen by others.  (Ironically, had she wanted to untag those photos, she would have had to join Facebook, and in doing so reveal other personal information.)</p>
<p>These examples highlight the aspect of PIM dealing with disclosure of personal information.  Many people would like to manage who sees what information about them and when they see it.  There is need for interfaces that help people understand and manage what they are disclosing and what others disclose about them.  This is not only a technical problem; clearly there are ethical, social, and legal questions that must be addressed: what rights do individuals have to limit the information disclosed about them, and how can those right be enforced?  Do we simply rely on social norms to prevent the inappropriate disclosure of personal information?  Should it be a requirement to notify people when their personal information is disclosed?  Should there be laws forbidding such disclosures in certain circumstances?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information For Me</h2>
<p>I generally focus on the other kind of PIM: tools that help people manage arbitrary information for their own purposes. Rather than being about the person, this can be impersonal information that has been brought into the user&#8217;s &#8220;orbit&#8221; by some task they have to do&#8212;data from or for work, news or entertainment they consume, or information they are managing on behalf of some other individual.  This is an incredibly broad class of information&#8212;just about every type of information can become part of your personal space.</p>
<p>For that reason, and because of the possible conflation with the previous &#8220;disclosure&#8221;-focused version, I find myself considering a different name than PIM: End User Information Management.   This phrase captures the crux of the problem&#8212;not the information being managed, but the person doing the managing.  It covers nearly every imaginable form of information, but unlike, for example, databases, transaction processing or scientific visualization, it focuses on problems encountered by end users without specialized training, and the tools and techniques that these non-specialized users can understand and use effectively.</p>
<p>I wish I could claim inventorship, but there is already some limited use of this term.  Gary Marchionini wrote a 1992 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~muresan/IR/Docs/Articles/jasisMarchionini1992.pdf" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/comminfo.rutgers.edu');">paper</a> on &#8220;End User Information Seeking.&#8221;  Mark Gregory has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://school-business.academia.edu/MarkGregory/Papers/256097/Collaboration_and_end-user_information_management_tools" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/school-business.academia.edu');">survey</a> on End User Information Management tools.</p>
<p>This label connects nicely to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://www.amazon.com/No-Code-Required-Giving-Transform/dp/012381541X" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.amazon.com');">End User Programming</a>, a closely related field.  End users often have workflow tasks that could &#8220;easily&#8221; be accomplished by programming.  But most end users are unfamiliar with programming languages, approaches and tools.  End User Programming aims to develop more broadly usable tools that put at least some of the benefits of programming in the hands of regular users.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/">UID</a> group at MIT has contributed to this area with tools like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/chickenfoot/">Chickenfoot</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://sikuli.csail.mit.edu/">Sikuli</a>. Given the role of computation in effective information management, End-User Programming clearly has an important role to play in End User Information Management.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first serious end-user programming was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/en.wikipedia.org');">Visicalc</a>, the original spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet cells could hold multiple pieces of inter-dependent state, enabling the user to describe complex multi-stage computational processes without authoring a program. Debugging was also simplified: instead of having to trace an execution, users could see all stages of the computation simultaneously displayed in the many spreadsheet cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the spreadsheet has also turned out to be the dominant end user information management tool, allowing users to store databases with arbitrary schemas as spreadsheet tables.  A colleague once told me of an extensive study he performed (but was never permitted to release) showing that most spreadsheets <em>did not contain numbers</em>: they were being used as databases, not as calculation engines.   Despite the availability of more sophisticated database tools, even those with UIs such as Access, end users seem wedded to simpler spreadsheet relatives.  Spreadsheets&#8217; use as databases has driven some evolution, as we now see spreadsheets offering sorting and filtering functionality not particularly relevant to their original accounting applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Untangling the Two</h2>
<p>The two types of PIM are often considered together.  This is understandable; at first glance a lot of the information managed by end users is in fact personal information&#8212;contacts, calendars, messages, personal photos and other media.  But I believe that this is a deceptive connection.  The information challenges I face trying to organize my personal photo collection (clearly a PIM activity) share a lot with the challenges faced by a professional photographer organizing his portfolio, which in turn are similar to those faced by a biologist organizing his specimens or a salesman organizing his samples.  When I organize my music for pleasure, it&#8217;s obviously PIM; the very similar work I do organizing music to DJ at my Israeli Folk Dance session must also be considered PIM.</p>
<p>Both kinds of PIM benefit from separate consideration.  For (Personal Information) Management, it&#8217;s important to realize that this problem reaches far beyond the subject of the information.  My personal information appears in many places and is managed by many people, and beyond the basic technical problems there are broad issues of ethics and policy. Conversely, as we consider End-User Information Management, it&#8217;s important to recognize, that it&#8217;s a problem much broader than dealing with our calendars, email, and social media.  End User Information Management aspires to give users the ability to work with a tremendous variety of information types, often requiring significant domain expertise.  But it aims to provide these abilities to individuals who have no specialized skills as programmers or information designers.</p>
<p>So far, the common approach to this problem has been to completely dis-empower users, packing the entire information management process into rigid applications that do everything the way their developer thinks it should be done.  I think we can do better, leveraging more of users innate understanding of their information to manage it more effectively, without requiring them to become database engineers.  But how to do so is a subject for a different post.</p>

					<p>Last weekend,  came to Boston to hold, for the first time, the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://edu.netbeans.org/courses/nbplatform-certified-training" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/edu.netbeans.org');">NetBeans Platform Training Course</a> as an IAP workshop here at MIT. It was a great three days, and as for myself, just about every single thing we were taught during the course will go straight into the software I am building for my Ph.D. project.</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650im_/http://www.mit.edu/~ebakke/netbeansiap/photo.jpg" alt="[Last Day Group Photo]"/></p>
<p>The NetBeans Platform, if you haven&#8217;t heard of it, is a large collection of Java APIs that work together to help you create production-grade, IDE-style desktop applications without spending years of development time re-inventing standard features such as dockable window panes, tree-views with nodes that can be opened into tabbed documents, graph views with draggable and selectable nodes, property sheets, automatic software updates, web launchers, installation packages, user-configurable menus, toolbars, and keyboard-shortcuts (or even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-ribbonbar.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/platform.netbeans.org');">Ribbon</a>!), context-sensitive actions, and much more. A major feature of the NetBeans Platform is also the module and service lookup system, which helps you plug all of these features together in a decoupled way, so that individual domain-specific features can be developed independently of each other. In fact, many companies are porting their applications to the NetBeans Platform exactly to take advantage of the module system and to disentangle their existing spaghetti code. Take a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://platform.netbeans.org/screenshots.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/platform.netbeans.org');">these screenshots</a> to see some of the many hundreds of large-scale applications that have already been built on or ported to the NetBeans Platform.</p>
<p>To see what a completely bare-bones NetBeans Platform application looks like, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://sieuferd.elasticbeanstalk.com/master.jnlp" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/sieuferd.elasticbeanstalk.com');">click here</a> and ignore all those pesky security warnings <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650im_/http://haystack.csail.mit.edu/blog/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/>  Eventually I&#8217;m going to port my existing research code into this kind of an empty shell of an application, and it should get some actual features. But for now, notice how we already have all the basic menus set up, a toolbar, a full-screen mode, and extendable options dialog with programmable keyboard shortcuts, a property sheet interface, and dockable subwindows. With a little bit of work, we can get a very professional-looking application up and running in a short amount of development time.</p>

					<p>With my background as a theoretical computer scientist, I&#8217;m a <em>terrible</em> programmer (Back in college taking operating systems, my team got special mention for having the most elegantly designed operating system, all built around a single semaphor API.  Of course it only executed for 30 seconds before crashing).  But sometimes, when I can&#8217;t convince any of my graduate students that it&#8217;s important enough, I have to step in and try to fix up some of our tools myself.    My Haystack group does a lot of HCI research on the web, which means a lot of our tools are in Javascript.   As I&#8217;ve been working to tweak those tools, two really obvious flaws in the environment, that pretty much <em>force</em> bad programming practice, have been jumping up repeatedly.   I&#8217;m curious why these flaws haven&#8217;t been fixed, and whether any of you readers have advice for overcoming them.</p>
<p>Both flaws stand out in some work I&#8217;m doing on our <a title="Dido system" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://projects.csail.mit.edu/exhibit/Dido/">Dido</a> system (a client-side WYSIWYG tool for managing data and its visualizations using <a title="Exhibit project" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://simile-widgets.org/exhibit/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/simile-widgets.org');">Exhibit</a>).  I&#8217;m trying to add a &#8220;Wizard&#8221;&#8212;a wrapper that will walk people through a sequence of interactions.  Each of which is already accessible using a toolbar, and pops up a dialog for the user to perform some operation, but the Wizard will save the user figuring out the toolbar by programatically opening each of the dialogs in sequence.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using <a title="jquery ui project" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://jqueryui.com/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/jqueryui.com');">jquery-ui</a> for the dialogs. The dialogs themselves are written in html, then buttons are defined with Javascript behaviors attached to them.  And this raises the first problem&#8212;fragmentation of modules.  Any dialog consists of an html part and a Javascript part, which pretty much forces them to go into separate files.  Which means you can&#8217;t get a unified picture of the &#8220;component&#8221;&#8212;its Javascript and html.  The html needs to be part of the main page (unless I want to go off and fetch auxiliary html content) while the Javascript should be in a separate js file.  In theory, I could write js code to dynamically generate the html I need, but this is really contrary to the notion that the dialog is in fact static html, and I should be able to look at it that way.  Given Javascript&#8217;s allergy to newlines in strings, it&#8217;s hard for me even to include the static html as a blob in the js.  Obviously I&#8217;m not the first person to be in this situation.  Are there any nice ways to package a &#8220;library&#8221; of Javascript plus html as a single, editable file that can then be included via a link from the main document?</p>
<p>The second problem emerges from the asynchronous interaction model of javascrit.  Like any browser-javscript library for this user interaction, jquery-ui is asynchronous.  My javascript can make a call to open a dialog, but then that thread of computation ends and interaction with the dialog is handled through callbacks that are invoked when dialog buttons are clicked.  These callbacks have no automatic connection to the thread that opened the dialog.  My Wizard doesn&#8217;t want to do things this way: I want to invoke the dialog, then have the wizard pick up when the dialog is closed.</p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s a way to do this in javascript&#8212;continuation passing.  I pass in a function that should be invoked when the dialog is closed, that picks up Wizarding where the dialog open left off.  This works just fine.  But I don&#8217;t like it.  The unrestricted passing of continuations lets people deal with them arbitrarily&#8212;which permits cool hacks but also gives the programmer autonomy to do hard-to-understand things.  It&#8217;s like bringing back goto&#8212;it can be used properly, but generally isn&#8217;t.   The last time I had to explicitly pass in a &#8220;return address&#8221; was when I was working on the assembly-language-based recalculation engine for Excel version 2.  High level programming languages are supposed to insulate me from managing the call stack!</p>
<p>And with the right language elements, this should be possible even in an asynchronous environment.  The semantics of a subroutine call are that computation should pick up on the next line when the subroutine completes.  So what if the completion of that subroutine is driven by an asynchronous event?  i.e., the dialog subroutine is one that starts by opening the dialog box, then yields until a button in the dialog is clicked, then picks up processing to figure out what to do about the clicked button.  And if it can remember that it is &#8220;picking up&#8221; from a previous thread, then that thread can return to the function that originally called the dialog.  I&#8217;d love to see javascript introducing language elements to support this, and I&#8217;m puzzled about why they haven&#8217;t already done so.  If any of you know any ways to cope with this, I&#8217;d love to hear.</p>

					<p>The host of NPR&#8217;s <em>This American Life</em> is talking about creative work here, but he might as well be reflecting on the first couple years of a PhD:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Crowds are already powering novel interactive systems like <a title="Soylent" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://soylent.csail.mit.edu/">word processors</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://vizwiz.org/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/vizwiz.org');">question answering</a> systems, but their reach is too limited: crowds are reasonable choices only when the user can wait a minute or more for a response. Users, of course, hate waiting &#8212; they abandon interfaces that are slow to react. Imagine a crowd-powered copy/paste mechanism: it becomes much less useful when you need to wait 50 seconds between copying and pasting.</p>
<p>Our goal is <strong>realtime crowdsourcing:</strong> completing non-trivial crowdsourced computation within seconds of the user’s request. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://people.csail.mit.edu/msbernst/papers/adrenaline-uist2011.pdf" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloadspeople./msbernst/papers/adrenaline-uist2011.pdf');">In our upcoming UIST paper</a>, we develop techniques that <strong>recruit crowds in two seconds and use them to complete complex search tasks in ten seconds</strong>.

<p> We use these techniques to create a quick-response crowd-powered camera called Adrenaline, which quickly finds the best moment to snap a photo. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IICXFUP6MM" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.youtube.com');">Check out a video of the system here.</a></p>

<p><strong>We believe that synchronous crowds are the key to realtime crowdsourcing. </strong>In synchronous crowds, all members arrive and work simultaneously. With synchronous crowds, systems can dynamically adapt tasks by leveraging the fact that workers are present at the same time.</p>
<p>There are two barriers to using synchronous crowds: recruitment and &#8220;crowd control&#8221; algorithms. To recruit synchronous crowds, we introduce the <strong>retainer model </strong>and a set of empirical guidelines for using it. The retainer model pays workers a small wage to wait and respond quickly when asked. Our most effective design results in a majority of workers returning within two seconds and 75% within three seconds. To guide crowds quickly, we then developed <strong>rapid refinement</strong>, which observes early signs of agreement in synchronous crowds and dynamically narrows the search space to focus on promising directions.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://crowdresearch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/refinement-01.png" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/crowdresearch.org');"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1600" title="Rapid Refinement" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650im_/http://crowdresearch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/refinement-01-300x242.png" alt="Rapid Refinement" width="300" height="242"/></a></p>
<p>This approach produces results that, on average, are of more reliable quality and arrive faster than even the fastest crowd member working alone.</p>
<p>The retainer model and rapid refinement open the door to powerful new interfaces like Adrenaline. But more importantly, they open the door to many other systems that needs synchronous crowds or fast results. For example, we developed A|B: a low-latency voting platform that returns a poll of five workers within about five seconds. Here, the sans-serifed font won 5-to-0.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650/http://crowdresearch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/a-b.png" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/crowdresearch.org');"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1601" title="A|B" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151201223650im_/http://crowdresearch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/a-b-1024x581.png" alt="A quick voting platform" width="448" height="254"/></a></p>
<p>We also see opportunities for realtime requester feedback and creative support. To explore these ideas, we developed Puppeteer, which allows crowds to help create lots of interestingly-varying alternatives to a photo. Here&#8217;s what it looks like when we want to create a dancing crowd:</p>

					<p>I sympathize with Google&#8217;s efforts to prevent impersonation on plus. But I didn&#8217;t think the real names policy was the right approach, and I don&#8217;t think the verification badge approach addresses the right problem either. Taking a concrete example, my real name is David Karger, and I can certainly get that verified. But there&#8217;s another David Karger out there (my doppleganger, film critic for Entertainment Weekly). If I get my name verified and then start posting &#8220;my draft movie reviews for Entertainment Weekly&#8221;, how exactly is name verification going to help people not be deceived?</p>
<p>They problem is that name is a (poor) proxy for identity. If Google wants to prevent me from impersonating that other David Karger, they need to demand something that only that David Karger can offer. And there&#8217;s an obvious approach that has been used in the past by Google. In order to prove that I manage a given web site, Google makes me modify a page on the site. This has general use. To prove that I&#8217;m the David who posted that EW article, I just need to put a signature on that article, and give google the public key needed to verify that signature.</p>
<p>This only offers &#8220;relative&#8221; identity, showing that two entities (the plus user and web page owner) are the same. But that&#8217;s all you can ever do&#8212;the the current &#8220;verification&#8221; scheme just aims to prove that a given plus user is the same as the holder of a particular name (and that comes with the problems mentioned above). Its main limitation is that it only allows you to associate two digital identities; associating to a real-world identity requires connection mechanisms outside the Internet (for example, I authenticate that I own a given phone number by receiving a call on that number that conveys a secret key I type back into the computer).</p>
<p>Perhaps google could use their weight to give a nice push to a general public key infrastructure. Imagine if every plus user automatically got a public/private key pair they could use to sign other digital artifacts, and google provided web-based software to verify those signatures? Besides providing (positive) identity verification on my Google plus account, this would also start to offer (negative) impersonation protection, as signing my artifacts would provide proof that I made them.</p>
